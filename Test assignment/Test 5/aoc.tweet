The major need that hospitals across the country are echoing: PPE supplies and equipment. COVID is set to spike. There aren’t enough masks, gloves, ventilators, beds, etc to treat people. Trump needed to order mass production over a week ago to save lives. He didn’t. https://twitter.com/podsaveamerica/status/1241420998408146946 …
That’s why we need to suspend mortgage, rent, & loan payments! It’s important people get money in, but we also need to stop the money out.
Let’s take this lesson and move it forward to push for a better world. We CAN guarantee healthcare. We CAN treat housing as a right. We CAN pursue decarceral policy. We CAN prioritize humanitarian foreign policy. We can. We can. We can.
One enormous, major lesson that I hope people realize in this moment: Resistance to revolutionary policy was never really about a lack of money, or capacity, or logistics. It was always about power and a lack of political will.
If price gouging COVID treatment shld be criminal, shouldn’t it be for insulin too? If mayors can suspend arrests on low-priority, low-level offenses, why didn’t they before? If mass evictions are a crisis now, why wasn’t the highest homelessness % since the Depression one too?
It’s important we realize how this virus hasn’t just created new problems; but poured gasoline on the crises we’ve long had. It’s okay if you didn’t see the extreme urgency of our healthcare, housing, wage, carceral, FPol,etc crises before. But I hope you don’t unsee them later.
We need to cover 100% of the costs of uninsured & underinsured people right now. Not just Coronavirus bills, either - getting sick can set off a domino effect of complications.

As Intel chairman, @SenatorBurr got private briefings about Coronavirus weeks ago. Burr knew how bad it would be. He told the truth to his wealthy donors, while assuring the public that we were fine.

2/3 of NYC residents are renters. Now that New York State has issued a MORTGAGE moratorium, we must also enact a RENT moratorium to prevent mass displacement. Relief and protection from displacement shouldn’t just be for homeowners and the wealthy. It should be for everyone.

96% of airline profits over the last decade went to buying up their own stocks to juice the price - not raising wages or other investments. If there is so much as a DIME of corporate bailout money in the next relief package, it should include a reinstated ban on stock buybacks.
Good. Now we must suspend student loan payments. Suspending interest does nothing if people still have to pay out the same amount in principal.

New York State is now suspending all STATE debt collection. Specifically, that means if you owe **New York State** any debt payments (student, medical, etc) you will not have to pay for at least the next 30 days. This is a great move. The federal gov should follow suit. https://twitter.com/nygovcuomo/status/1239970795348094983 …

(And because he qualifies for a pension, he would still receive a check long after leaving the Senate.) So maybe, just once, we can fight so every American can have the dignity of housing, food, & education without feeling like we’re one illness away from life falling apart.
We need to bailout tipped, freelance, hourly/shift & gig workers. That means: UBI / cash assistance Rent, Mortgage, & Debt payment suspensions Paid leave for EVERY worker Immediate unemployment insurance Guaranteed healthcare We can’t leave anyone behind. https://twitter.com/ambiej/status/1240018163498131460 …
This is unacceptable. Trump is using this public health crisis as an opportunity to push tax cuts and corporate bailouts. This is an emergency. We need to help vulnerable people & small biz now w/ paid leave, extended unemployment, UBI, Medicaid expansion,&mortgage suspensions. https://twitter.com/johnrobertsFox/status/1239901548580425728 …
What we should seriously start to consider now for the medium & long term (bc it will take time) is New Deal-style policy. We need a mix of policies to help put a lot of people to work. Climate transition, edu expansion w/ apprenticeships & colleges, M4A. These are jobs bills.
BE CAREFUL with UBI proposals you see popping up. They are not all created equal, & they can have large macroeconomic, inflationary & systemic effects. Proposals should be weighed in a larger policy mix incl paymnt suspensions, jobs guarantee, unemp. expansion, paid leave,etc.
A Federal Jobs Guarantee is a complementary program that addresses some people’s immediate problem (lack of work) without pumping cash w/o productivity into the economy. Jobs Guarantee does not solve the issue for everyone but it should also be considered in the policy mix.
People have harped on me about “Trojan horse” comments I’ve made before abt UBI policies,but seriously: not every UBI policy is created equal. Some are structured in predatory ways to gut the safety net & reward banks, others are better w/people’s well-being in mind. Be careful.
Cash is important but if you do it w/o payment suspensions then it’s still everyday people footing the bill. Corporations, lenders, and banks need to do their fair share. UBI shouldn’t be used as an excuse for not pausing mortgage & student loan payments, halting interest, etc. https://twitter.com/mehdirhasan/status/1239594034093592577 …
One way or another we are going to have to address liquidity shock that Americans are facing. Whether it’s UBI, mortgage/rent/loan suspensions, or other means, if we do not act quickly many people will go hungry, be driven out of their homes, or confront other extreme harms.
GOP & Democrats are both coming to the same conclusion: Universal Basic Income is going to have to play a role in helping Americans weather this crisis. @RoKhanna & @TimRyan’s proposal goes up to $6,000/mo depending on need. Mitt Romney just came out for a flat $1,000 universal. https://twitter.com/jmartnyt/status/1239578864822767617 …
Don’t say you support a fracking ban when you don’t. Don’t say you didn’t write the bankruptcy bill when you were one of it’s biggest champions. Don’t say you supported ending Hyde a long time ago when you were just pressured into it last year. This is basic. The truth matters.
$1.7T is not enough to tackle climate change. Inadequate climate plans are a form of denialism over how bad this problem really is. My generation & future ones will have to contend with the horrifying mess that the cowardly leadership of previous ones left us. It’s a betrayal.
40% of Americans can’t afford a $400 emergency, & that’s before COVID. The faster we addresses wage & rent concerns for people & small businesses, the faster we can get everyone to self-isolate. People are going to work &small biz are staying open bc they’ll go under otherwise. pic.twitter.com/tELvZ0uiko
Last night on a tip-off call I headed to LaGuardia airport & intercepted @ICEgov transporting several children to NYC, an outbreak hub, via commercial air. If the Pentagon has halted all domestic travel for military, why is ICE transporting unaccompanied children in a pandemic?
We need real paid sick leave, right now, for every worker, no exceptions.
(The merit of the political strategy of the Dem fight is a different question - we should force the GOP to publicly defend their indefensible positions more and in real time, imo.)
Yes. Waiting period has been waived.
If your member is in touch w/ home, they are likely doing the same. Having a Dem rep isn’t a “set it and forget it” thing. Don’t just say “oh, they’ll do the right thing.” We NEED you to help us understand what you care about. 2 districts could have diff top 3 priorities. CALL.

There is a *huge* difference between UBI proposals that kick millions of people off Medicaid, SNAP, etc (aka people ending with net less $) w/o consent and a UBI proposal that provides people with net more in their lives. Conflating the two is dangerous and creates resistance.
Expanding small biz loans is an acceptable consideration- but we must avoid allowing this crisis to put millions of people in insurmountable debt. Checks to people are good and I applaud the proposal, but it’s not enough. But we need payment suspensions to get people through.
I first starting learning about this from meeting w/ you!
Yes. Full transparency: My issues w/ non-emergency UBI have to do w/ domino effects that have not been sufficiently addressed: triggering mass disqualification thresholds on Medicaid, SNAP, & many other programs, inflationary concerns, etc. I’m open to it but we need to bake it. https://twitter.com/seemiaroll/status/1239595351885127681 …
These proposals should be handled with care and consideration, particularly with respect to macroeconomic effects. But they should be considered nevertheless. Other countries are getting by w/ payment suspensions, which also creates that cash buffer. https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1239582664669253634 …
While political leaders are quick to point fingers at other countries, they still continue to champion TRADE DEALS w/ no emission standards. When Bernie brought up climate in a previous debate on trade, he was chastised. He takes climate change seriously. Other policies do not.
On rent we need to impose eviction moratoriums immediately as an emergency measure, but that’s not enough. We need to determine medium-term relief solution to offset a pending ripple of missed rent/mortgage payments. /2
Chef Chang is absolutely right. Fed gov needs to take decisive action NOW to protect restaurant workers, small businesses, & other vulnerable workers. We need tackle solutions to stabilize liquidity re: rent & wages. On wages we shld move on UBI & real paid leave. /1 https://twitter.com/davidchang/status/1239209490924351492 …

Dems presented a much stronger bill. GOP/WH held it hostage for ~two days and chipped it away. These negotiations were closed door so it is tough to say who demanded what, but Dems presented their original version so the tracked changes shows the result of GOP/WH negotiation.

Our NY14 tele-town hall is starting NOW with experts from: NYC Dept of Health NYC Dept of Ed US & NYC Census Bureau. You can follow along with the FB livestream:  https://m.facebook.com/repAOC/
The need for social distancing from restaurants only underscores the need for relief for tipped workers, freelancers, shift workers, etc. Tax credits & unemployment insurance does not help many of these workers - that’s a huge segment of our economy. We need emergency UBI, now.
What does “crowded” mean? If you can’t stay 6ft away from other people, it’s too close. In general, when going outside try to stay at least 6 feet away from others as much as you possibly can.
To everyone in NYC but ESPECIALLY healthy people & people under 40 (bc from what I’m observing that’s who needs to hear this again): PLEASE stop crowding bars, restaurants, and public spaces right now. Eat your meals at home. If you are healthy, you could be spreading COVID.

We have a bipartisan package that passed the House tonight & has been agreed to by the White House. McConnell needs to bring the Senate back now and call a vote. I don’t care if it’s a Saturday. COVID doubling rate means every 24 hours represents a critical window. #WheresMitch?
Every minute, hour, & day that Fed action is delayed on Coronavirus puts lives at risk. The House has been hammering away at a coronavirus relief package. We just called in every member to vote on & pass a deal at almost 1am. #WheresMitch McConnell? Taking the weekend off.
I’ve been discussing policy responses for Coronavirus, but there is plenty we can also do to care for each other, NYC! - Check on your neighbors (can be through the door) - Offer to run errands for the elderly - Tip (a lot) extra if you can - Donate to food pantries,shelters,etc
We need to dramatically expand #COVIDー19 testing and *processing* capacity. It’s imperative to our public health that everyone who needs a test can get it easily and for free as quickly as possible - no matter whether you’re a sports star or a single parent. https://twitter.com/Public_Citizen/status/1238238009637601280 …
Hey all, wanted to drop a for accountability. I usually don’t go on FOX on principle, but misinformation about coronavirus has made me concerned about risk. As a result I decided to go on @BretBaier to discuss coronavirus response + make the case for paid leave, Medicaid, etc
Want to know one major reason why South Korea has had stellar rapid response and quickly produced & scaled up to 10k+ tests/day? They have a single payer, #MedicareForAll system. We don’t. Please remember why it’s so important for us to fight for healthcare as a human right.
FYI, the amount that the Fed just injected almost covers all student loan debt in the US. There is absolutely NO excuse for not pausing student debt collections, planning for mortgage &rent relief, etc. We need to care for working people as much as we care for the stock market. https://twitter.com/AliVelshi/status/1238153956645363714 …
This is not the time for half measures. We need to take dramatic action now to stave off the worst public health & economic affects. That includes making moves on paid leave, debt relief, waiving work req’s, guaranteeing healthcare, UBI, detention relief(pretrial, elderly, imm)
The Federal government should consider pausing collection on student loan debt.
I find it amusing that GOPers stalk my livestreams to obsess over any & every word, bc I’m *actually available* to constituent Qs at 10pm after a long day. Meanwhile, many GOP electeds hide from constituents & avoid town halls. Maybe that’s why they’re so preoccupied w/ mine
Right about now would be a great time to weigh emergency measures like: - Extending Medicare/Medicaid coverage to all - Eviction freezes - No-strings UBI programs - Eliminating work requirements for SNAP &other assistance - Humanitarian provisions in prisons & decarceral policies

Coronavirus tips! In addition to washing your hands, make sure you are also wiping down: - Doorknobs - Light switches - Your cell phone - Arm rests - Car/bike handles - & anything your hands touch regularly! A spray or cleaner works fine. Be well!

It’s truly time to retire the misogynist trope that angry men are powerful, yet angry women are unhinged. It’s such gaslighting nonsense. You SHOULD be mad at abuse of power. The real question is how one channels that energy into positive change that creates justice.

Also, billionaires don’t have a billion dollars because they “work” thousands of times harder than the teacher or the single mom. They are billionaires because the stock market makes that money for them, which relies on profiteering off insulin, low wages, scrapped jobs, etc.
In a time when ~60% of American workers make less than $40,000 a year, billionaires should not exist.
Fracking is NOT a transitional fuel, and it is dangerous to say so. Fracking emits methane, which is about **84 TIMES** more powerful than CO2 in contributing to climate change for a generation.

Rep. Scalise, the only way you‘d conclude this is if you thought foreign interference is Trump‘s main strategy to win in 2020. Letting our elections be subverted by hostile actors *IS* disastrous.

Rep. Mooney, you & I both know that when a massive crime is committed, the 1st step is to separate witnesses & get their stories to see what adds up.

Domestic abusers can be master manipulators. Plus, domestic abuse is a HUGE indicator for gun violence. That’s why “vouching for friend” isn’t a substitute for a background check. You wouldn’t lend a car to someone w/o a license.Why lend a gun to someone w/o a background check?
This idea of “I know the guy, there’s no way he beats his wife” as the way we keep guns out of the hands of abusers is ridiculous.

5) The Electoral College isn’t about fairness at all; it’s about empowering some voters over others. Every vote should be = in America, no matter who you are or where you come from. The right thing to do is establish a Popular Vote. & GOP will do everything they can to fight it.
4) We do not give electoral affirmative action to any other group in America. Do Black Americans have their votes count more bc they have been disenfranchised for 100s of years? Do Reservations get an electoral vote? Does Puerto Rico and US territories get them? No. They don’t.
2) This common claim about “if we don’t have the Electoral College then a handful of states will determine the presidency” is BS. a. It’s the *EC itself* that breaks down power by state, pop vote decentralizes it b. The EC makes it so a handful of states DO determine elections
I see Fox News is big mad about abolishing the electoral college. So let’s talk about it. 1) If the GOP were the “silent majority” they claim, they wouldn’t be so scared of a popular vote. They *know* they aren’t the majority. They rely on establishing minority rule for power.

What Congress can do about exploding white supremacist terrorism: pass gun safety laws, name WS as terrorism in statute, &more. The House passed gun safety bills mos ago. McConnell refuses to hold a VOTE, let alone pass them. He needs to call the Senate back now & do so. #HR8
If I were a journalist/worked in news, this is what I’d do rn: 1. Interview actual experts on white supremacy & give them space (more than 2mins or lines) to educate the public on WS, what to look for. Often. 2. Not frame white supremacy&racism as a “conflict” or “debate”... /1
Using the words “invasion,” “infestation,”w respect to a specific, targeted group of people, implying they are vermin: this is the language of white supremacy &it goes all the way to the top.

AKA his tweets may be used to dismantle his own immigration policies  https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trumps-racist-comments-can-be-used-against-him-in-court-as-judges-cite-them-to-block-policies/2019/07/16/6ed0ea6a-a7f1-11e9-86dd-d7f0e60391e9_story.html …
My mom was a domestic worker - she cleaned houses to support our family. As a little girl, I grew up reading books on other people’s staircases. I did homework on other people’s dinner tables.

You’re right, Mr. President - you don’t have a racist bone in your body. You have a racist mind in your head, and a racist heart in your chest. That’s why you violate the rights of children and tell the Congresswoman who represents your home borough, to “go back to my country.” https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1151129281134768128 …
Donald Trump has decided he does not want to be President of the United States. He does not want to be a President to those who disagree. And he’d rather see most Americans leave than handle our nation’s enshrined tradition of dissent. But we don’t leave the things we love.
Hey Mr. President, remember when you bragged about sexually assaulting women, talking about feeling their breasts and genitals, because “when you’re a star they let you do it?” And then you imposed DOE policies to make it harder for sexual assault survivors to report assault? https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1151089268535767042 …

I see @LindseyGrahamSC’s biggest issue w/ Trump’s racism is that it doesn’t go far enough - Graham wants to bring back 1950s McCarthyism, too. GOP is doing this because they have no plan for our future. We’re the ones fighting for healthcare, edu, good jobs, & they got nothing. https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1150748086488240128 …
Until Republican officials denounce yesterday’s explicitly racist statements (which should be easy!), we sadly have no choice but to assume they condone it.

It’s important to note that the President’s words yday, telling four American Congresswomen of color “go back to your own country,” is hallmark language of white supremacists. Trump feels comfortable leading the GOP into outright racism, and that should concern all Americans.
You know what we’re going to do tomorrow? Same thing we do every week. Fight for: Living wages & unions A humane border Healthcare + edu as rights Loosening the grip of corp lobbyists on our democracy They can stay busy defending racism. We’ve got things to do.
But you know what’s the rub of it all, Mr. President? On top of not accepting an America that elected us, you cannot accept that we don’t fear you,either. You can’t accept that we will call your bluff & offer a positive vision for this country. And that’s what makes you seethe.
You are angry because you can’t conceive of an America that includes us. You rely on a frightened America for your plunder. You won’t accept a nation that sees healthcare as a right or education as a #1 priority, especially where we’re the ones fighting for it. Yet here we are.
You are angry because you don’t believe in an America where I represent New York 14, where the good people of Minnesota elected @IlhanMN, where @RashidaTlaib fights for Michigan families, where @AyannaPressley champions little girls in Boston. /2
Mr. President, the country I “come from,” & the country we all swear to, is the United States.

132 members - incl GOP & Independents - voted against creating the Dept of Homeland Security. Don’t let people rewrite history as if DHS/ICE always existed, or is a no-brainer. It’s a young agency, ill-conceived after 9/11 & sacrificed our civil liberties - like the Patriot Act.
It’s really not that radical.

Trump spent millions on a poorly attended, 1 day parade days after saying he couldn’t afford toothpaste & soap for caged children. Did he ask Congress for military parade? No. Trump held these kids hostage to secure billions for their abusers. Congress needs to see that.
CBP is trying to refute the toilet drinking story by saying their toilets have sinks. The sink in the cell we visited wasn’t functional.

Are CBP officers waking up women in the middle of sleep a “funding” problem? Is calling migrants “filthy” “wh*res” a funding problem? Is threatening violence on members of Congress a “funding” problem? No, it’s not. It’s a far deeper, systemic, more violent problem than that.
The $4.6 billion wasn’t humanitarian at all. It had NO accountability measures for facilities that abuse children and families. It didn’t fix the problem, just funded abuse.

I can’t understate how disturbing it was that CBP officers were openly disrespectful of the Congressional tour.

And to these CBP officers saying they felt “threatened” by me - They were literally discussing making a GoFundMe for an officer who attacked my on my tour. They confiscated my phone, and they were all armed. I’m 5’4”. They’re just upset I exposed their inhumane behavior.
Members of Congress had to surrender their phones before today’s CBP trip. But @JoaquinCastrotx was able to get a device in. This photo is of the women we spoke to. We asked their permission to photograph - they said yes, please share what’s happening. https://twitter.com/JoaquinCastrotx/status/1145837857539612673 …
CBP made us check our phones. But one woman slipped me this packet to take with me. It says “shampoo,” but she told me that this is all they give women to wash their entire body. Nothing else. Some women’s hair was falling out. Others had gone 15 days without taking a shower. pic.twitter.com/OsaKS0YD9a
What’s haunting is that the women I met with today told me in no uncertain terms that they would experience retribution for telling us what they shared. They all began sobbing - out of fear of being punished, out of sickness, out of desperation, lack of sleep, trauma, despair.
Now I’m on my way to Clint, where the Trump admin was denying children toothpaste and soap. This has been horrifying so far. It is hard to understate the enormity of the problem. We’re talking systemic cruelty w/ a dehumanizing culture that treats them like animals.
After I forced myself into a cell w/ women&began speaking to them, one of them described their treatment at the hands of officers as “psychological warfare” - waking them at odd hours for no reason, calling them wh*res, etc. Tell me what about that is due to a “lack of funding?”
Now I’ve seen the inside of these facilities. It’s not just the kids. It’s everyone. People drinking out of toilets, officers laughing in front of members Congress. I brought it up to their superiors. They said “officers are under stress & act out sometimes.” No accountability.
Just left the 1st CBP facility. I see why CBP officers were being so physically &sexually threatening towards me. Officers were keeping women in cells w/ no water & had told them to drink out of the toilets. This was them on their GOOD behavior in front of members of Congress.
There are 20,000 TOTAL Customs & Border Patrol agents in the US. 9,500 - almost HALF that number - are in a racist & sexually violent secret CBP Facebook group.

This just broke: a secret Facebook group of 9,500 CBP officers discussed making a GoFundMe for officers to harm myself & Rep. Escobar during our visit to CBP facilities & mocked migrant deaths.

Gotta love the rich irony of people who fondly recount stories of how their family’s last names were changed on Ellis Island after their relatives snuck onto a boat escaping some horror now taking fervent anti-immigrant stances & branding innocent human beings as “illegal.”
One narrative in this country that we need to turn on its head is the lie that immigrants are “takers,” or represent a weight on society. It’s wrong. Immigrants are *makers.* They create+offer opportunity. They aren’t a weight to carry; in fact, they are our nation’s shoulders.
In meeting I asked “Why can the president take money from other agencies to build his little wall, but can’t move money to get kids toothpaste?” It’s bc his “nat’l emergency” is ONLY to build his wall. But he won’t declare an emergency to save these kids & get them help.
Mitch McConnell killed the House border $ over “poison pill riders.” What are the “poison pills” he’s talking about? Protections for kids & punishment for inhumane facility co’s.

We are calling these camps what they are because they fit squarely in an academic consensus and definition. History will be kind to those who stood up to this injustice. So say what you will. Kids are dying and I’m not here to make people feel comfortable about that.
My heroes are the ones who stood up when it wasn’t easy. Kids are dying in cages on our border. Families are being put in “freezers” & “dog pounds.” Years from now, people will look for the journalists, officials, & everyday people who stood up for what was right in real-time.

DHS ripped 1000s of children from their parents & put them in cages w inhumane conditions. They call their cells “dog pounds” & “freezers.” I will never apologize for calling these camps what they are. If that makes you uncomfortable, fight the camps - not the nomenclature. https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1141385159230537728 …
The US ran concentration camps before, when we rounded up Japanese people during WWII. It is such a shameful history that we largely ignore it. These camps occur throughout history. Many refuse to learn from that shame, but here we are today. We have an obligation to end them. https://twitter.com/missanabeem/status/1141122682915889153 …

Also @Liz_Cheney, the fact that you employed the horrifying word “exterminated” here (co-opting the language of the oppressor) tells us that it’s *you* that needs to brush up on your reading.

Hey Rep. Cheney, since you’re so eager to “educate me,” I’m curious: What do YOU call building mass camps of people being detained without a trial? How would you dress up DHS’s mass separation of thousands children at the border from their parents? https://twitter.com/Liz_Cheney/status/1140988893627478018 …
And for the shrieking Republicans who don’t know the difference: concentration camps are not the same as death camps. Concentration camps are considered by experts as “the mass detention of civilians without trial.” And that’s exactly what this administration is doing.
This administration has established concentration camps on the southern border of the United States for immigrants, where they are being brutalized with dehumanizing conditions and dying. This is not hyperbole. It is the conclusion of expert analysis  https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a27813648/concentration-camps-southern-border-migrant-detention-facilities-trump/ …

Ultimately, this is about women’s power. When women are in control of their sexuality, it threatens a core element underpinning right-wing ideology: patriarchy. It’s a brutal form of oppression to seize control of the 1 essential thing a person should command: their own body.
Abortion bans aren’t just about controlling women’s bodies. They’re about controlling women’s sexuality. Owning women. From limiting birth control to banning comprehensive sex ed, US religious fundamentalists are working hard to outlaw sex that falls outside their theology.

If you think your ‘celibacy’ is due to “female empowerment,” maybe it’s because far too many people relied on the disempowerment + silence of women to not be ‘celibate’ in the first place. https://twitter.com/TheEconomist/status/1127634770131922944 …
Ultimately, living in a moral society, a good nation, means establishing some basic standards of dignity: - healthcare as a right - a living wage - public education that prepares for civil society + economy (which now shld incl college) - all people having power in the economy
When we say “tax the rich,” we mean nesting-doll yacht rich. For-profit prison rich. Betsy DeVos, student-loan-shark rich. Trick-the-country-into-war rich. Subsidizing-workforce-w-food-stamps rich. Because THAT kind of rich is simply not good for society, & it’s like 10 people.
It’s a big part of what makes this Chase tweet so bad. It’s the idea that if you choose to have any expense beyond mere animalistic survival - an iced coffee, a cab after a 18hr shift on your feet - you deserve suffering, eviction, or skipped medicine. You don’t. Nobody does. pic.twitter.com/XKo6ayPfRJ
The myth that bad credit or struggling w bills = irresponsibility is a heinous myth. Paying people less than what’s needed to live is what’s actually irresponsible. GDP + costs are rising, wages are not. That doesn’t mean YOU’RE bad. It means working people are set up to fail.
Now I’m going through a huge income transition compared to living off tips (which diff pay every week, very hard). & I have HEALTH INSURANCE, which now means I have fewer expenses. According to banks, I’d be more “responsible,” but my character hasn’t changed. Just my math. /3
Going from waitressing a year ago to now carries a LOT of life-adjustments. But 3 paychecks in has shown me how 1 of the greatest scams in US is the idea that financial struggle is due to “poor character.” It’s a huge myth designed to keep people from empowering themselves. /1

If you don’t understand this man’s sign - or don’t approach it with a desire to - then you do not understand this political moment. The same folks who said Trump was impossible in 2016 are the same ones lecturing on what’s “electable” in 2020. Don’t buy it. Vote your values.
About an hour ago, I was walking out of my office for the day. There was a man what I believe was his teenage son hanging a small sign they made outside my office (we let people leave well wishes on our wall). Astonishingly, his sign read: “Trump supporters for Ocasio-Cortez.” pic.twitter.com/IjVKbvetEI
This is a dealbreaker. There is no “middle ground” w/ climate denial & delay. Blaming “blue collar” Americans as the main opponents to bold climate policy is gas lobbyist 101.

I’d like to share another “unusual” (but shouldn’t be) part of my office policy w/ you all: Parental Leave! Three members of our small team are expectant or new parents in the first 6 mos of my term. In my office, *every* new parent receives 3 mos paid leave - including dads.
Really, the biggest, boldest idea (other than war) the GOP has proposed is A Wall. At this rate they’re gonna propose getting us to space w/ trebuchets. They constantly hate, but have 0 real solutions for income inequality, healthcare, climate crisis, racial injustice, etc.
GOP is talking smack about the Post Office (of course, since they have no ideas). The funny thing about that: it‘s the GOP’s own “business model” that hurt them! They forced USPS to prefund pensions decades out (which makes NO sense & no solvent biz does)instead of year to year.
“This is crazy!” “Just pay your bills!” “You need higher interest for poor people!” 1st of all, 15% interest is already a TON. Most credit unions are subject to usury law; they’re quite sound. in fact, they’re the few who DIDN’T need a bailout in ‘08. So let’s talk about it  https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/1126520351368859648 …
There is no reason a person should pay more than 15% interest in the United States. It’s common sense - in fact, we had these Usury laws until the 70s. (Max interest rates are record-high for ppl with excellent credit, too.) It’s a debt trap for working people + it has to end. https://twitter.com/business/status/1126497054526775296 …
Before we won, climate issues were ranked very low in nat’l voter priorities. Thanks to risk-taking activism, it’s now consistently ranked as a #1 or at least a top 3 issue for many voters. Leadership is often about choice: take the temperature, or change the thermostat.
That’s too bad. The President does not exist above Congress, he governs alongside us. That’s what co-equal means. If he prefers to rule by fiat, he’s welcome to resign and return to the Trump Org tax-fraud fiefdom in the private sector whenever he pleases. Checks & balances  https://twitter.com/TwitterMoments/status/1126146336045379584 …
If your “business model” is based on caging kids, keeping fams in freezing rooms to save on heating costs, and for-profit incarceration, you shouldn’t be in business at all. Caging people shouldn’t be a financially incentivized activity. For-profit prisons should be banned. https://twitter.com/altochulo/status/1126101052913332224 …
For context, this kicks in within days of a typical at-home test working. If you were sexually assaulted (stress delays cycle), took a morning-after pill (throws off cycle), or have an irregular cycle, you‘d have no idea. There are a TON of ways this law ignores basic biology.
“6 weeks pregnant” = 2 weeks late on your period. Most of the men writing these bills don’t know the first thing about a woman’s body outside of the things they want from it. It’s relatively common for a woman to have a late period + not be pregnant. So this is a backdoor ban. https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/1125778778377027589 …

Solidarity > “civility,” bc you can very civil while arguing for the inhumane + unacceptable. You can be “civil” while locking up kids & drugging them in detention camps, or stripping people of their insulin or civil rights. Civility is abt appearance. Solidarity is abt action.

In order for us to heal as a nation, we ALL must pursue the hard work of addressing these root causes. It’s not as easy as voting. It means having uncomfortable moments convos w/ loved ones, w/ media, w/ those we disagree, and yes - within our own party, too. It’s on all of us.
He can stay, he can go. He can be impeached, or voted out in 2020. But removing Trump will not remove the infrastructure of an entire party that embraced him; the dark money that funded him; the online radicalization that drummed his army; nor the racism he amplified+reanimated.
This is the REAL conversation we need to have as a country. As horrific as this president is, he is a symptom of much deeper problems.

The way we reject the 0-sum idea that some communities win at the cost of others is by using opportunities to address issues intersectionally - to highlight that Antisemitism, Islamophobia, and all bigotry serve the same ends & that we prevent division by championing one another.
None of this is “whataboutism.” Racism and bigotry of all forms is inextricably linked. When you don’t address them as a system and attempt to pick them apart as though they are distinct and separable issues, eventually the thing that gets advanced is white supremacy + classism.
The entire PREMISE of a wall is not based in fact. It’s based in a racist + non-evidence based trope that immigrants are dangerous. Yet some Dems are willing to “compromise” & spend BILLIONS on a trope because we’ve accepted some kinds of racism as realpolitik in America.
If we’re so concerned about implied tropes, why aren’t we concerned about this one? Where was the concern last week when 26 Dems voted for a GOP amendment to expand ICE powers rooted in the racist + false trope that Latino immigrants are more dangerous than US born citizens? https://twitter.com/ryangrim/status/1103124376151605249 …

We can have ideological differences and that’s fine. But these tactics allow a small group to force the other 200+ members into actions that the majority disagree with. I don’t think that’s right, and said as much in a closed door meeting.
Mind you, the same small splinter group of Dems that tried to deny Pelosi the speakership, fund the wall during the shutdown when the public didn’t want it, & are now voting in surprise ICE amendments to gun safety legislation are being called the “moderate wing” of the party.
If you’re mad that I think people SHOULD KNOW when Dems vote to expand ICE powers, then be mad. ICE is a dangerous agency with 0 accountability, widespread reporting of rape, abuse of power, + children dying in DHS custody. Having a D next to your name doesn’t make that right.
Again, didn’t threaten a primary. I was upset that 26 Dems forced the other 200+ to vote for a pro-ICE provision at the last min without warning.

As a person who actually worked for tips & hourly wages in my life, instead of having to learn about it 2nd-hand, I can tell you that most people want to be paid enough to live.

It’s pretty sad that people think low Congressional staff pay is a good thing. Low pay a big reason why money in politics is a problem - you can make a lot more money becoming a lobbyist & setting up a relationship w/ one, since the actual job doesn’t pay enough. Domino effect.
Leadership starts with our choices. That’s why I decided that no one on my staff will make less than $52k/year. It’s likely one of the highest entry-level salaries on the Hill.

I went to the Senate yesterday w/ my colleagues to witness who was voting against reopening govmnt. I watched them huddle & look around. They know this is on them.

According to @LindseyGrahamSC, the President failing to condemn neo-nazis, forcing thousands of federal workers to go to food pantries,& risking all their credit scores is whatever, but not letting the President march down the House Floor until we pay people first is “a new low.” https://twitter.com/KellyO/status/1088192295176994817 …

Me: “I don’t think billionaires should concentrate wealth while employing people who are sleeping in cars working a zillion hours to survive.” Next day: “That will be TEN PINOCCHIOS to Ocasio, ‘zillion’ is not a number and I found someone who sleeps in a tent, not a car.”
This reinforces lazy tropes about women leaders in media: - Older + seasoned, but unlikeable - Passionate, but angry - Smart, but crazy - Well-intentioned, but naive - Attractive, but uninformed or gaffe-prone It’s unoriginal, lazy, and men don’t get the same either/or coverage.

For some reason GOP seems to think this is a gaffe, but it’s actually a generational difference.

The odds of me making over $10 million in one year while serving in public office are probably as slim as the odds of the GOP ever understanding what a marginal tax rate is.

Let’s dig into “gravitas,” bc it’s an ambiguous word, selectively applied.

800,000 workers are missing their paychecks and we’re pushing to get them paid ASAP. We’re here doing our job - the House has voted to reopen government whole or in part several times - so why can’t we find GOP Senators to ask them do theirs? #WheresMitch pic.twitter.com/FogCPg6ayZ
I could’ve sat there quietly as the far right tore me to shreds (they were guaranteed to do so the moment a woman like me won my primary), or I could fight back+not let them. I chose to define myself instead of allowing them to take that away from me. And that’s why they’re mad.
I’m uneasy about it too. It’s stressful & scary, but it’s also out of my control, so the best thing I can do is try to focus that attention on the most urgent issues of our time: climate change, good gov, jobs, wages, justice; and highlight the contradictions you explain here. https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1085635523031547916 …

We have secured enough Republican votes in the Senate to reopen government. Our obstacle now is Mitch McConnell, who won’t call the vote for what seems like 2 reasons: 1.

Explaining marginal taxes to a far-right former Governor: Imagine if you did chores for abuela & she gave you $10. When you got home, you got to keep it, because it’s only $10.

Freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences. King’s district should start working to replace him in 2020. Regardless of party, it’s not good for a district if their Rep has such reprehensible views that they aren’t allowed to touch legislation with a 10 ft pole.

Journalism isn’t just about the questions you ask, but the questions you don’t. If you’re a reporter or pundit who has badgered every Dem about “socialism” yet aren’t asking EVERY Republican about what they plan to do about Rep. King’s white supremacy,you’re telling on yourself.

“Seeds.” Out of the minority of seats they have in Congress, the GOP allowed a white supremacist to represent ~700,000 people. Republicans won’t even censure him. They also protect a president who can’t bring himself to condemn neo-Nazis. Those aren’t seeds. They’re redwoods. https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1083964094171045888 …
I keep thinking about this exchange bc there are many aspects that are concerning to hear from an *editor.* This is what false equivalence looks like: diminishing Trump‘s “enemy of the people” talk as “scolding” & describing my call to hire a black journalist as the same thing. https://twitter.com/HotlineJosh/status/1084284162654306306 …
This week I learned some members spend as little as 5 hours per WEEK in their office bc their fundraising commitments are so high. It’s not them, it’s our broken system of campaign finance.

Or: maybe having powerful editorial positions awash in people from one race, class, or gender isn’t a good idea; since we get 1000% more takes on “brown lady says a curse word” than an actual white supremacist in Congress.

How can the GOP expect all TSA & other workers to reliably show up without a paycheck? Workers rely on services like childcare and transit to work in the first place. Those services don’t take IOUs.

At this point those who use the terms “racially tinged” or “racially charged” to describe white supremacy should be prepared to explain why they chose to employ those terms instead of “racist”/“racism.” If the answer is their own discomfort, they’re protecting the wrong people.

Let’s learn about this, shall we? Many have recognized that @FoxNews has crossed a line beyond conservatism and into outright bigotry with their financing of Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham. Tucker finances the @DailyCaller, which posted fake nudes of me. Here’s a breakdown https://twitter.com/voxdotcom/status/954432032146247681 …
a) this is not an apology b) you’ve been posting hysteric, misrepresentative articles about me nonstop - many within 24h. The @DailyCaller, funded by @TuckerCarlson (at @FoxNews), has a well-documented relationship with white supremacy. Unsurprising they’re targeting me. https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/1083184988282077189 …
For those out of the loop, Republicans began to circulate a fake nude photo of me. The @DailyCaller reposted it (!) and refused to indicate it was fake in the title as well. Completely disgusting behavior from Conservative outlets. No wonder they defended Kavanaugh so fiercely.
