The problem with actual prepper-level crises is that they demand social responses, not individual ones. The prepper's quest for individual meaning and supremacy means that he can never be actually prepared, because the way to solve a crisis is run towards it, not away. 10/
I just listened to the most interesting coverage of the pandemic I've heard so far: @onthemedia's deep reporting on how preppers are coping with the Current Situation.  https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/segments/why-preppers-werent-really-prepared-pandemic … 1/

In this case, it seems to me that stimulus spending runs the risk of being inflationary (when everyone tries to redeem their plane ticket vouchers at once) or useless (people throw away their vouchers). Stimulus + supply shock = ?? 5/
But that runs into a big problem: there's ANOTHER reason people aren't making discretionary purchases, which is that those goods and services aren't available (manufacture has been disrupted by social distancing) or aren't safe (flying is incompatible with social distancing). 4/
Or there could be a hybrid, such as distributing vouchers to the public, redeemable for discretionary purchases - instead of bailing out aviation, we could buy people plane tickets, for example. 3/
In theory, the covid contraction is a great candidate for MMT stimulus. If people are stockpiling cash and thus eliminating their discretionary spending (40% of US GDP!), then the state can procure the discretionary items without triggering inflation. 2/

The message of Little Brother is neither "Things will all be fine" nor "We are all doomed." It's: "This will be so great...if we don't screw it up." /eof
The Little Brother books are neither optimistic nor pessimistic about technology: instead, they are hopeful. Hope is the belief that you can materially improve your life if you take action. A belief in human agency and the power of self-determination. 8/

Trump isn't just a non-expert, he's an ignoranamus, but that's not the problem. The problem is that he is a nihilist, someone who doesn't believe that truth-seeking is even possible. /eof
For these people, the existence of bridges that don't fall down and water that doesn't give you cholera are lucky accidents, not results of sound policy and careful truth-seeking. They reason that since they would take bribes to poison the water of Flint, so would everyone. 18/
These people project their own moral vacuum onto all of humanity, a kind of cartoon Homo Economicus who is incapable of anything except maximizing personal utility. 17/
He is part of the cult of "Public Choice Theory," the belief that there is no one who can serve as referee without eventually colluding with the players for their mutual enrichment, a cynical, nihilistic philosophy that holds that there's no point in seeking to govern well. 16/
The problem of Trump taking charge of the epidemiological crisis of Covid-19 isn't that he doesn't understand science: it's that he doesn't believe in evidence-based policy. 15/
The problem with Trump's Covid-19 response is that he does not believe in a legitimate process with neutral referees. The refereeship, in trumpland, is an open-field auction, a transactional process that works best when it enriches Trump and his party. 14/
So many of us saw the photo of Trump meeting with all the tech leaders and were dismayed that they were throwing their lot in with him. But we should also be aghast that all the leaders of the industry fit around one modest board-room table.  https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/14/donald-trump-meets-with-tech-leaders/ … 13/
There's no way for there NOT to be collusion in these circumstances. And when an industry is that concentrated, the only people who understand it well enough are those same execs, so inevitably the regulators are drawn from the industry. 11/
This, then, is the problem with inequality and market concentration: it merges the referees with the players. When an industry only has a handful of players, they all end up with common lobbying positions - a common position on what is truth. 9/
Good policy comes from truth-seeking exercises in which experts with different views present their best evidence to neutral adjudicators who make determinations in public, showing their work in explicit, written, public reasoning. 6/
The fact that we're not all dead of cholera, even though there are no microbiologists in Congress proves that you don't need to be a domain expert to make good policy. 5/

KP: Excellent! Everybody in America hear that -- you are eligible to go get tested for coronavirus and have that covered, regardless of insurance [Curtain] /eof
KP: Dr Redfield, you don't need to do any work to operationalize. You need to make a commitment to the American people so they come in to get tested. You can operationalize the payment structure tomorrow -- RR: I think you're an excellent questioner, so my answer is yes 14/
RR: Our intent is to make sure that every American family gets the care and treatment they need at this time in this major epidemic and I am currently working with HHS to see how to best operationalize it. 13/
RR: What I was trying to say is that CDC is working with HHS now to see how we operationalize that KP: Dr. Redfield, I hope that that answer weighs heavily on you, because it is going to weigh very heavily on me and on every American family 12/
KP: Nope, not good enough. Yes or no? RR: What I'm going to say is, I'm going to review it in detail with CDC and the department -- KP: No, reclaiming my time [repeats the question] 11/
KP: Dr. Redfield, will you commit to the CDC, right now, using that existing authority to pay for diagnostic testing, free to every American, regardless of insurance? RR: Well, I can say that we're going to do everything to make sure everybody can get the care they need --" 10/
Having laid this factual record, Porter insisted that Redfield commit to using that authority. Not to consider it, study it, or consult on it. To use it to help save the country. Whenever Redfield waffled, she reclaimed her time and forced him back on point. 9/
Then she forced CDC Director Robert Redfield to admit - as she had informed him in writing a week before - that the CDC had the authority to simply pay those fees, universally, for any American seeking testing, under 42 CFR 71.30:  https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2019-title42-vol1/xml/CFR-2019-title42-vol1-part71.xml#seqnum71.30 … 8/
Porter doggedly held Kadlec to account, forcing him to acknowledge that the cost of a Covid-19 test - $1,331 - was so high that many would forego it, and then to admit that these Americans could go on to transmit the disease to others, making it a matter of public concern. 7/
That's because today was the day she questioned CDC assistant secretary for preparedness and response Robert Kadlec, asking him to clarify Trump's televised lie last night that insurers would pay for Covid-19 testing.  https://twitter.com/RepKatiePorter/status/1238147835859779584 … 6/

It's disaster capitalism at its worst. The Senate GOP is dooming you and everyone you love to the risk of disease and death because preventing that risk would help millions of poor people, whereas creating the risk helps a handful of ultrarich people. /eof
Whereas the crisis that this will produce - a pandemic that is made worse and longer - will cost billions more, but that money will go to the donor-class, the Beltway Bandits whose cost-plus, no-bid contracts will transfer even more money from the poor to the wealthy. 5/
Refusing to help poor Americans stay fed and sheltered isn't just cruel, it's lethally reckless, and it demonstrates the moral hazard of oligarchic capitalism. Subsidizing sick-leave would merely afford survival to millions of Americans, after all. 4/

As @wolfofwolfst writes, Boeing, this "master of financial engineering – instead of aircraft engineering – blew, wasted, and incinerated $43.4 billion on buying back its own shares." The company just had to borrow $13.825B. Its shares are down 46% since March 2019. 3/
Obviously, Boeing can't be blamed for the pandemic. But you know what is ABSOLUTELY the company's fault? Its financial engineering. Since 2013, Boeing squandered $43 BILLION on stock buybacks, whose sole purpose was to goose its share-price. 2/
Boeing is experiencing a potentially terminal slump. Between losses due to its 737 Max scandal (a self-inflicted injury), and the dropoff in travel during the pandemic, it has had to draw down its entire line of credit and institute a hiring freeze.  https://wolfstreet.com/2020/03/11/boeing-crashes-as-43-billion-in-past-share-buybacks-turn-into-existential-threat/ … 1/

As Potter points out, Biden's assertion that M4A costs $35T is just a lie. Once you factor in the savings of not paying for private healthcare, M4A SAVES at least $450B/year.  https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)33019-3/fulltext#%20 … 6/

So I was really interested in this 1995 open access study, "A Satiety Index of common foods," which offers a league table of the foods that made subjects feel full.  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15701207_A_Satiety_Index_of_common_foods … 4/
For me, satiety is the barrier to sticking to any diet. I don't just get ravenous, I get these all-consuming cravings that I can't put out of my mind, even if I resist them (and the longer I resist, the more likely it is that I'll really blow it out when I give in at last). 3/
No other diet since has had that effect. I really struggle with cravings (and have put 50lbs back on through my 40s, though some of that is muscle from a much higher level of exercise). 2/
I lost ~100lbs in 2002/3 with a low-carb diet. The thing I immediately noticed when I started eating (lots) more fat and (lots) less carbs was that I was always satiated, with none of the food cravings that had plagued me all my life. 1/

This is the kind of best-practice that ever browser vendor should be adopting. Of course, we also need a federal privacy bill with a private right of action, and until we get one, this is doubly important. /eof
Brave says the other tactics used to block fingerprinting are "useless" and describes how randomization is more effective, citing peer-reviewed studies to support its case.  https://brave.com/whats-brave-done-for-my-privacy-lately-episode3/ … 4/
This has gone from "theoretical risk" to "main tool for user tracking" in a few short years. Browsers take different approaches to fighting these attacks, but I like Brave's: it's going to randomize browser data when it's requested by servers.  https://www.zdnet.com/article/brave-to-generate-random-browser-fingerprints-to-preserve-user-privacy/ … 3/
Brave is one of the two browsers I use every day (the other is Firefox). I really like the company's approach to privacy and user-control, which is deeply embedded in their culture (unlike Mozilla, Brave fought against DRM in browsers at the W3C, for example). 1/
Whomever came up with this policy at Sonos is a colossal asshole. The whole company should be ashamed. I am a Sonos customer (bought Sonos One speakers when they started making a model with no mic) and I enjoy them, but I don't know that I'll ever trust the company. /eof
The company is working on an alternative (which, one hopes, will not be as malicious and deceptive as the previous version). The reason for bricking devices is obvious: it eliminates competition from used devices. The reasons not to do it are also obvious: it's terrible. 3/
When you get rid of a Sonos product - either through a trade in or disposal - the company advised you to trigger "recycling mode" to wipe your account data. But this didn't wipe the speaker - it BRICKED it.  https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/03/sonos-backtracks-on-bricking-your-trade-ins-will-allow-reuse/ … 1/
Piketty's endorsement of Warren's wealth tax was hugely important. His endorsement of Sanders' entire program, and Sanders' electability, is even more important at this phase of the battle to abolish Trumpism and save our planet. /eof

If you or someone you love in Detroit has no water, you can get your service reconnected starting tomorrow at 313-386-9727. /eof
Michigan - whose neoliberal belief in "moral hazard" dictates that poor people should not have benefits - has engineered a situation in which the state is full of desperately poor people who will sicken the people around them. 5/
Many people will be able to afford the $25/month. Some will not. Who doesn't have $25/month for water? The poorest, most vulnerable people, who are disproportionately likely to be immunocompromised and susceptible to Covid-19. 4/
So the state of Michigan and the city of Detroit have teamed up to turn on peoples' water during the crisis. The reconnection fee of $25 (a tax on poor people) will be picked up by the state. But it will be $25/month afterwards. 3/
In Detroit, many people are without (substandard) water, as they've been faced with the choice of paying rent or paying the water bill. This means that they can't wash their hands. 2/
Michigan has been a living laboratory for neoliberal cruelty, as gerrymandering has allowed the rich white people to dominate the state, stripmine its public assets, and privatize its services, leading to mass evictions (and the lead crisis in Flint).  https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/detroit-to-restore-water-service-to-unpaid-homes-to-allow-people-to-wash-their-hands-to-avoid-coronavirus … 1/

As @crookedfootball writes, "[Authoritarians will] use COVID-19 to advance their nationalist and anti-immigrant agenda. Journalists need to ask them what they are doing to stop that very agenda from having consequences that shame and endanger us all." /eof
Likewise (and doubly so) for the refugee gulags created Greece and Australia. It's not only inhumane to deprive the people in these camps of care - it's also a way to create and sustain reservoirs of illness that will spread into your general population. 6/
A civilised society shouldn't put people at risk of violence in order to attain its immigration goals. A healthy society - one that contains the spread of pandemics - CAN'T afford to put its immigration goals ahead of these matters. It's both ethical and pragmatic. 5/
In "The Ethics of Immigration," Joseph Carens argues for a "firewall" between public services and immigration enforcement, specifically to address situations like these (and also related issues, like spousal abuse, child abuse, etc).  https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-ethics-of-immigration-9780199933839?cc=us&lang=en& … 4/
This creates enormous deterrents to seeking medical care, which means that migrants - disproportionately found in low-waged jobs including cleaning and food service - are less likely to seek care or present themselves for testing if they develop symptoms. 2/
The UK took the decision to "create a hostile environment" for migrants, which entails denying medical care to those who can't prove their entitlement to it. Seeking care in the UK comes with threats to your residency and/or titanic bills.  https//crookedtimber.org/2020/03/10/covid-19-and-migration-we-need-a-firewall/ … 1/

Deere tractors frequently brick themselves when their sensors misfire. But they can also be remotely bricked from Deere headquarters, if the company detects unauthorized modifications. They claim they only do this in China. So far. eof/
They lie like hell about their commitment to repair, falsely claiming that independent repair shops have access to codes, parts and manuals. Even ex-John Deere techs who start independent repair businesses can't access those materials. 10/
Deere never told farmers it was going to extract data from their tractors - everything from the moment you open the door is logged and transmitted - and did not reveal that new models had SIMs in them, until they were caught and had to come clean. 9/
Publishers who serve farmers - and rely on Deere advertising money - refuse to cover the Right to Repair movement, with cowardly excuses like "It generates more heat than light." 8/
Meanwhile, your crops are being destroyed by the cold weather snap that caused the tractor's sensors to misfire. The difficulty of sourcing repairs leads farmers to disable their (notoriously balky) emission control systems, rather than getting them fixed. 7/
Deere killed Nebraska's Right to Repair legislation, suborning powerful state politicians to serve out-of-state corporate interests at the expense of farmers. So now, when your tractor malfunctions, you have to wait days to pay a tech hundreds of dollars to clear the error. 6/
John Deere tractors harvest the data that farmers generate when they use them - soil condition data gleaned from humidity and torque sensors - and sell it to Big Ag, and into the futures markets - but deny farmers access to their own data. 5/
It's the ultimate rebuttal of "if you're not paying for the product, you're the product." Farmers pay $800k for tractors. They're still the product. The right way to think about this: "If a monopolist can get away with treating you like their product, you're the product." 4/
Deere has led the exploitation of Section 1201 of the DMCA, which makes it a felony to tamper with "copyright access controls." They've designed their products so that using them in ways that benefit you, the owner, instead of their shareholders, requires violating DMCA1201. 3/
Deere has the gall to call modifying your tractor (say, to improve your horsepower) "theft of services," because they offer it as an upgrade. They have, through digital technology, conjured up a new shadow federal statute: "Felony contempt of business-model." 2/

Hundreds of UC faculty have signed open letters in support of the TAs. The UC system is a jewel in the state's crown, but rising tuitions and precarity for academics endanger that, even as administrative costs and sports expenses balloon. This is long overdue. /eof
And their union - which had been hanging them out to dry as "wildcatters" - is now moving in its bargaining team to act on their behalf (better late than never, but jeez). Grad students/TAs at UNC, Notre Dame, Ole Miss, and U Sussex have all expressed public solidarity. 7/
There are pickets at UCLA, Berkeley, Santa Barbara, Irvine and Riverside. UCSD TAs are refusing to grade papers.

It's real Moff Tarkin bullshit, and as we all know, the failure mode for that move is, "The more you tighten your grip the more star systems will slip through your fingers." The latest slippage comes from UC students and faculty, who have declared a systemwide strike. 5/
The university reached a new, disgusting low last week when it fired 70 TAs, including several non-citizens who now face deportation:  https://www.npr.org/2020/03/05/812645046/uc-santa-cruz-fires-over-70-striking-graduate-teaching-assistants … 4/
UCSC, meanwhile, is raking in money by increasing tuition and undergrad enrolment, which adds to grad students' work burden - and then starkly refusing to share enough with those grad students to enable them to survive without food-poverty. 3/
The UC system's response has been shameful: violent, high-handed and dismissive, and it has backfired, inspiring sympathy strikes and solidarity actions across the system and the country. 2/
UCSC grad students have been on strike since December, demanding a living wage via a cost-of-living allowance increase (without these increases, employees take real-terms pay-cuts every year). 1/

As anyone who saw Beyond Thunderdome knows, pigshit is very flammable, and damaged pedometer batteries are also prone to starting fires. Which is how a farm near Leeds lost 75m of ground cover.

The official Product Repair Guide fits right in with the company's longstanding ethic and messaging (after all, these are the people who ran an anti-consumerism campaign called "Do Not Buy This Jacket!").  https://www.treehugger.com/sustainable-fashion/patagonia-will-teach-you-how-repair-clothes.html … eof/
So it's delightful (but not surprising) that Patagonia have partnered with @iFixit to produce detailed repair and maintenance documentation for its products.  https://www.ifixit.com/Wiki/Patagonia_Product_Care … 3/
Companies that offer lifetime guarantees want their customers to be able to effect their own repairs and maintenance - unlike companies whose profits depend on you throwing away and replacing your purchases every 18 months.  https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1236674693681143814 … 2/

If the new ecodesign directive covers mobile phones, the Commission will finally be addressing one of the great e-waste sources worldwide. 9/
Which brings us to today, as the EU is contemplating a new set of Right to Repair rules, including rules for electronics, including - possibly - phones. The new rules will be published this week, and Apple has lobbied heavily against this outcome. 8/
Apple is a one-company environmental apocalypse, with the industry's worst practices for old/broken electronics. Others fix systems, re-use parts, and keep parts available. Apple literally orders its partners to shred it all and turn it into landfill.  https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/yp73jw/apple-recycling-iphones-macbooks … 5/
Especially when considered in light of its investor disclosures, which make it clear that the company views the tendency of customers to fix and keep their phones (rather than buying new ones) as THE major threat to its profitability.  https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/ … 4/
Apple, after all, is the most repair-hostile manufacturer in the world. It's official reasoning on this is laughably terrible and transparent.  https://www.ifixit.com/News/33977/apple-told-congress-how-repair-should-work-we-respond … 3/
Though the official reasoning for not mandating Right to Repair for phones - which are universal and a major source of e-waste - is that the sector is too fast-moving to regulate, it's far more likely that the EU shied away because were scared to pick a fight with $ APPL. 2/
The EU has led the world on #RightToRepair, with extensive regulation mandating both easy-to-repair designs and manufacturer cooperation with the independent repair sector. But there's been one glaring omission in EU rules: smartphones. 1/
Covid-19 has crashed aviation demand, but not flights themselves. Miraculously, UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps - an otherwise useless idiot - has led on this, asking British aviation regulators to relax the 80/20 rule.  https://twitter.com/grantshapps/status/1235614933292920832 … eof/

They aren't self employed. They have an app that exercises fine-grained control over their work in a way that would have given Frederick Taylor the fantods. "Self-employed" is a fiction to avoid paying benefits. And of course there aren't examples...yet.

As a recovering bookseller myself, it's one of the great pleasures of the tours. Bookstores are community hubs, and were key to my own literary upbringing. This is just delightful news. /eof
It's superb news for a nation where bookselling has been imperilled for decades. On every tour stop, I always insist that my media escort take me to every B&N in town to sign stock and meet the booksellers. 11/
And Daunt's public plan for BN - America's last major chain bookstore - is to replicate what he did with Waterstones. Let the stores run like indies, with local control by experienced booksellers who know and care about their customers' tastes.  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-03-04/barnes-noble-wants-to-be-more-like-an-indie-bookseller … 7/
The new Waterstones stores are spectacular. There were always some great ones (the @WaterstonesBD1 shop in Bradford rivals the main Daunt books for beauty), but the vibe and experience of shopping at a post-Daunt Waterstones is a million times better than before. 4/
Daunt took over @Waterstones in 2011 and rescued it. The chain now runs as a string of indies, with no co-op promotion - instead, the booksellers in each shop choose which books they promote based on local taste. 2/
A great hero of British bookselling is @JamesDaunt, the founder of Daunt Books, whose flagship store is literally the most beautiful bookstore I've ever been to.  https://dauntbooks.co.uk/shops/marylebone/ … 1/ pic.twitter.com/cw1sFLoBmP

Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, we don't get fooled again." -GWB Punishing legit customers to get at pirates is a surefire way to make more pirates. "Might as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb." 14/
But customers don't like getting punished for "doing the right thing." If media companies cancel playback for purchased content on affected Intel systems, they won't be targeting pirates (who get their media DRM-free), but people who deliberately chose to pay. 13/
The temptation to downgrade your customers' property to up your profits is irresistible.  https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/09/what-hp-must-do-make-amends-its-self-destructing-printers … 12/
Not because you hacked your system, but because you COULD. DRM is and always has been a timebomb, ticking down to the moment that execs in a distant boardroom decide to nerf or brick your property. 11/
This is a thermonuclear option that could make DRM unviable forever. It means that if you had the misfortune to buy an Intel system during the five years that they were manufactured with this defect, you could lose the ability to play content you've already paid for. 10/
This compromise (when it comes) has profound implications for DRM, which is intrinsically brittle in that it's "break once, break everywhere." Once content is extracted from a DRM wrapper on a compromised system, it can be shared and played back on intact ones. 8/
But of course, if your Management Engine itself is compromised, then - by design - the part of the computer that you control can neither monitor it, nor prevent it from doing malicious work. In 2017, a ghastly ME bug showed how risky this was.  https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/05/intels-management-engine-security-hazard-and-users-need-way-disable-it … 3/
The Management Engine has long been controversial. It's designed to reach into your RAM and tinker with it in a way that, by design, the CPU can't detect or prevent. This is deliberate: it lets the management engine monitor and disrupt malware.  https://boingboing.net/2016/06/15/intel-x86-processors-ship-with.html … 2/
A new showstopper Intel bug compromises the Converged Security and Management Engine, the computer-within-a-computer that Intel uses for a variety of purposes, some beneficial (detecting malware), some terrible (shutting out free software).  https://blog.ptsecurity.com/2020/03/intelx86-root-of-trust-loss-of-trust.html … 1/

. @Lyft's advice to drivers: "disinfect your car" and avoid passengers who appear sick. /5
“[Amazon is ] basically threatening that I’ll be out of work if I have any symptoms of being sick, coronavirus or not, but no protections and no offers for help in the event it happens" - Jeff Perry, Amazon Flex/Uber driver, Sacramento 4/
As @SarahNEmerson speculates in her @ozm piece, this depraved indifference is likely an epiphenomenon of gig economy companies' urge to preserve the fiction that their workers are contractors, not employees. Contractors don't get sick leave, after all. 3/
It's not just Amazon Flex drivers who are being tacitly incentivized by rapacious, giant corporations to show up for work sick. Your Uber, Lyft and Instacart drivers are all being given a stark choice: work sick or go broke. 2/

Fulfilling deletion requests costs companies about $10. You can use them punitively. Any time a company pisses you off, you can just file a data-deletion demand under CCPA. 6/
Once you're signed up, you can opt out your whole family, and even your friends. If you don't want a $3/month sub (which gets you tons of other awesome robolawyering), you can just sign up once, pay $3, purge your records and cancel. 5/
Donotpay automates opt-outs for these companies. It also automates suing companies that don't comply or those that make illegal demands like requiring you to send a scan of your driver's license before they'll purge your records. 4/
Every single person should purge their data from every single data-broker, period. Donotpay targets the top 20 brokers and facial recognition companies, including Clearview AI. 3/
Data-brokers don't just drive nuisance calls, they also expose you to risks like being doxed and swatted, or having your identity stolen, including by stalkers and bounty hunters who exploit mobile phone tracking to get your realtime location. 2/

This won't just protect users, it will protect publishers. It's one thing to prohibit publishers from intrusive advertising. But it's another altogether to make that kind of advertising literally technically impossible. /eof
But all of that needs to be accompanied with legal cover for users who assert the right to unshittify their web sessions.  https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/adblocking-how-about-nah … 17/
We should address monopolies in ad-tech and browsers, we should create meaningful privacy protections via a federal privacy law with a private right of action. 16/
Even when they're not, browsers are being designed to serve publishers (who are under advertisers' thumbs), not users.  https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/09/open-letter-w3c-director-ceo-team-and-membership … 15/
The pop-up wars were won because technologists helped users exercise technological self-determination. But increasingly, browser vendors are ad-tech companies. 14/
When Opera, and then Mozilla, turned pop-up blocking on by default, users finally had a meaningful reason to prefer one browser to the others. One browser was usable. The other one let pop-up ads crash your computer and eat your unsaved docs. 12/
They'd spawn 3 more pop-ups for every one you closed, or 300, until your computer ran out of RAM and crashed, taking all your work with it. These pop-ups didn't go away because publishers won the battle. They went away because of pop-up blocking. 11/
These were unbelievably terrible, even by modern standards. Pop-ups would spawn at 1px X 1px, making them invisible, autoplaying audio. Others would sense your mouse heading for the close box and move themselves away from your pointer. 10/
This happened before, of course. It's an HTML5, CSS-enabled reprise of the pop-up wars, where exploding inventory and finite advertising allowed advertisers to play publishers off against each other with increasingly obnoxious, intrusive pop-ups. 9/
But Roth isn't merely complaining here. He's also digging into the underlying reality: dwindling margins, short-term thinking, monopolization of the ad-market, and a buyer's market for ads that lets advertisers demand worse and worse of publishers. 7/

We know who his political allies were: the VVD party. When the Netherlands' dikes fail and the country begins to drown, these politicians might still be running for office. 7/

Böttcher was a packrat. His papers in the Noord-Hollands Archief in Haarlem stack 15.9m tall. Inside of them is an eye-wateringly detailed account of how wealthy, planet-wrecking firms deliberately and maliciously paid for climate denial. 5/
In his papers, Böttcher notes that after he published these frauds, Shell contacted him and offered him giant sums to keep it up and amplify it. The work was personally commissioned by Shell managing director Huub Van Engelshoven. 4/
Despite this, his 24 sponsors dumped him in 1998 after the signing of the Kyoto Protocol, worried that outright climate denial had lost credibility. No wonder! This was the guy who'd called climate science "a witch-hunt on CO2" and declared "Our planet is not a greenhouse." 3/
His network pushed out scientific frauds like the idea that excess atmospheric CO2 would be "good for plants" through books, lectures and reports. He was good at it. His work was crucial to stalling action on climate change in the 1990s. 2/

Colonial American industry enjoyed a huge advantage over UK rivals because it disregarded UK patents and copyrights, allowing American firms to leapfrog the former colonial masters. Now that it is a net exporter of tech, it expects foreign countries to respect its rules. eof/
These mods also show how Adversarial Interop is key to technological self-determination. Rather than meekly submitting to digital colonialism, modders ignore the choices and preferences of a massive US firm and its shareholders and deliver local solutions for local people. 6/

Moral: When it comes to Youtube, it doesn't matter if you're a nationally recognized copyright expert. You can't argue with anonymous, hamfisted rights-enforcer assholes to assert your speech rights. The only way to guarantee those rights is to know someone on the inside. /eof
Now, these are eminent law professors at a top university, so they were able to make some insider calls to Youtube, who lifted the complaints altogether and reinstated the video. But no one ever clarified the multiple-claims/multiple copystrike procedure. 7/
These clips weren't just fair use; they'd been chosen by top legal scholars to illustrate what fair use WAS. The rightsholder reps who issued the takedown claims for these videos did so manually - that is, these complaints were not automatically generated. 3/
The video of the panel was taken down from Youtube after multiple copyright complaints from rightsholders who claimed that the brief clips, chosen by America's leading copyright experts as being fair use, were infringing.  https://www.law.nyu.edu/centers/engelberg/news/2020-03-04-youtube-takedown … 2/

Generally I'm in accord with the essay. I just don't think the studies cited are of very high quality and/or recency. It's OK to say, "I love bookstores and libraries because they're fabulous" without having to provide evidence for that fabulousness. eof/
Libraries, of course, are the last place in our civilization where you are welcomed because you are a human being, not because you are an ambulatory wallet. Librarians, resist the urge to call people "customers." They're "patrons." That's far more dignified (and accurate). 8/

Right to Repair is how our hospitals, schools, infrastructure maintenance, first responder and other vital services will keep the lights on if things go horribly wrong. Resiliency may be bad for shareholder value, but it's vital to human survival. /eof
But redundancy is the key to graceful failure-modes. Limiting repairs to authorized service centers works well (reliable, and certainly great for shareholders), but it fails very, very badly. 5/
A key principle of resilience is to put resources at the edge, replacing hub-and-spoke models with point-to-point, peer-to-peer ones that infuse the system with redundancy. Neoliberalism hates redundancy and equates it with wastefulness.  https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1228326004508151808 … 4/
Covid can put everyone - even entire nations - into the position of that isolated farmer. As Long Beach port is denuded of shipping containers, as air- and rail-links are broken between parts of the country, the stream of source parts, replacement units and technicians stops. 3/
It's no coincidence that farms and farmers have been leaders in Right to Repair: when you're isolated and you're not allowed to fix your stuff, it means that you can neither nip down to the shops for a replacement, nor easily have an authorized repair tech come to your place. 2/

Fuckery extreme: The Warner-Chappell claim was not automated. A human manually claimed this phrase of music as Warner-Chappell's, despite: a) Them having disclaimed ownership of it in a lawsuit, b) Losing that suit and being told by a court that it wasn't theirs. 10/

Gaye's heirs should not have won that suit. But they did. And it opened the floodgates to nuisance suits targeting the likes of Perry and her publisher, Warner-Chappell. They lost the suit and got hit for $2.8m. This isn't even the fuckery part, by the way. 6/
Buckle up for this one, as it is an onion of bizarre, bad-faith corporate behavior, with each layer peeling back to reveal another, even weirder and more terrible one. 3/
This is sleazy even by Warner Chappell standards, and they're the crooks who fraudulently claimed ownership over Happy Birthday for decades.  https://vimeo.com/172715640 2/
I've seen some next-level copyfraud fuckery in my day, believe me, but @adamneelybass's tale of @WarnerChappell's absurd copyfraud reaches a new height of absurdity.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM6X2MEl7R8 … 1/

If a troll really is around 9 times as strong as a strong man, we might figure that a troll sledgehammer might be something like 81kg, and a troll warhammer only 5.76 – 13.59kg. Wildly short of the massive clubs and hammers the trolls wield in these scenes." /eof pic.twitter.com/Jb5LHKdLtX
By far the most intensely geeky section is in Part V, which deals with the math for calculating whether the trolls could possibly heft the hammers that deal the damage that we see.  https://acoup.blog/2019/06/07/collections-the-siege-of-gondor-part-v-just-flailing-about-flails/ … /11
The orc general,Gothmog has to push through the ranks and reorder his infantry, while the orcs stare dumbfounded at the new threat. This is a task that should have been taken up by a hundred-hundred NCOs up and down the line, which speaks to problems of command structure." /10
My favorite part of the section on calvary charge was the notable absence of NCOs in the orc ranks, maintaining discipline.  https://acoup.blog/2019/05/31/collections-the-siege-of-gondor-part-iv-the-cavalry-arrives/ … /9 pic.twitter.com/S1wo9e52XU
In assaulting a fortified city with a large army, the spade is often the most important weapon. Even building a ramp right up the enemy walls to enter the city was a common and successful tactic, if the assaulting army had enough labor to do it quickly enough." /8
The paths the siege towers will take must be cleared and leveled (even a slight grade will tip them over). Earthwork cover for the approach on the gate should be set up, along with obstructions to prevent the army within the city from advancing at an inopportune moment." /7
Instead, Gondor executes its plans admirably, and yet it is so outmatched in military might that it remains in peril." 5/ pic.twitter.com/4MkAZ4Op6w
The section on the siege's opener, part II, is likewise fascinating and contains some great craft notes.  https://acoup.blog/2019/05/17/collections-the-siege-of-gondor-part-ii-these-beacons-are-liiiiiiit/ … "LOTR doesn't rely – as so much fiction does – on the ‘good guys’ making stupid mistake after stupid mistake in order to create tension." 4/
At that length, the tail end of the army would not even be able to leave camp before the front of the army had finished marching for the day." (!!) /3 pic.twitter.com/TxqturMLkT
The road the orcs are on allows them to march five abreast, meaning there are 40,000 such rows. Giving each orc four feet of space on the march , that would mean the army alone stretches 30 miles down a single road." 3/
It's in 7 parts, broken down by themes. By far my favorite section was the opener, on the logistics of sieges. I am a quartermaster by temperament, and the logistic of moving 200,000 orcs (plus trolls, elephants, siege engines, etc) is FASCINATING.  https://acoup.blog/2019/05/10/collections-the-siege-of-gondor/ … 2/
Last spring, Roman military historian @BretDevereaux published over 40,000 words of analysis of the Siege of Gondor as depicted in Peter Jackson's Return of the King. It is by far the best use of fiction as a tool for teaching history that I've ever read. 1/

NOBUS is, and always has been, a dead letter - equivalent to stockpiling superbugs to use as bioweapons, in hopes that no one else will discover or steal them, rather than developing a vaccine for them. It's the height of irresponsibility, and your tax-dollars pay for it. /eof

Once you discover a snippet of malicious code in the wild (either something used by a spy agency and then blown, or something stolen from the agency), it's really easy to remix it to deliver your own malware. 3/
But as ex-NSA hacker Patrick Wardle's RSA presentation, "Repurposed Malware: A Dark Side of Recycling" shows, foreign spy agencies - and criminals - love NOBUS because it means they get to steal NSA cyberweapons and use them for themselves.  https://www.rsaconference.com/usa/agenda/repurposed-malware-a-dark-side-of-recycling … 2/
The NSA has a doctrine called "NOBUS," which stands for "No One But Us" -- as in, "It's OK if we keep these bugs we discovered a secret because no one but us is smart enough to find or exploit them." 1/
Literally all of this was obvious from the start, and boosters of upload filters hand-waved them away, insisting they were mere technicalities that could be solved by asking tech companies to NERD HARDER. Now, the whole thing is likely to fall apart. /eof
This a terrible idea in an era of rampant copyfraud. The Directive has no penalties for people who falsely claim copyright even when it's to rip off, blackmail or censor artists, and platforms still have to accept their copyright claims even after they're caught at it. 2/
The EU's #CopyrightDirective effectively forces all online platforms to implement #UploadFilters that scan everything you try to post and refuses anything that matches a database of works that anyone, anywhere has claimed to be "copyrighted." 1/

Merely expanding the "author's monopoly" does no good in a world of industrial monopolies: it just gives those monopolists more ammo to use in the fight to shift revenues onto their own balance sheets, at the expense of working creators. /eof
What would a copyright look like that protected artists, rather than practicing the Magic Underpants Gnome method of: 1. Enrich entertainment corporations; 2. ????? 3. Artists get more money 9/
It's easy to feel smug about copyright maximalists being hoist on their own petards. But the end-game is easy to see: just make selling your "vibe" rights a condition of signing a record deal, and you transfer ownership of whole genres to the Big 4 labels. 8/
It doesn't buy the kid lunch, it just gives the bullies the opportunity to take more money from your kid. After the "Blurred Lines" suit, labels fret about being sued artists' copying the "vibe" of another artist. 7/
Which means that anyone hoping to sample must sign to a label and pay for a license either to that label or one of the other three. Giving new rights to artists in a monopolized market is like giving your bullied kid more lunch money. 6/
Those artists experienced a temporary enrichment when paying for samples became the norm, but today, all contracts simply require signing away your sampling rights. The fight to require licenses for samples merely gave the labels yet another right to demand of their artists. 5/
Think of how samples could originally be used without permission (in the Paul's Boutique/It Takes a Nation of Millions era), enriching old R&B artists who'd been burned by one-sided contracts. (image from @kembrew's "Creative License  https://www.dukeupress.edu/creative-license …) 4/ pic.twitter.com/EDllzVokp4
In an increasingly concentrated marketplace, any exclusive rights that are given to creators are simply appropriated by corporations as a non-negotiable condition of the standard contract. 3/
The column is called "A Lever Without a Fulcrum is Just a Stick": copyright is billed as giving creators leverage over the corporations we contract with, but levers need fulcrums.  https://locusmag.com/2020/03/cory-doctorow-a-lever-without-a-fulcrum-is-just-a-stick/ … 2/
My latest Locus column explores what copyright expert @rgibli calls "The New Copyright Bargain" - a copyright system explored around enriching authors above all, rather than as an incidental output of enriching entertainment or tech corporations. 1/

But Oregon Dems are too timid to call white nationalism out when they see it. They won't run on the issue of the GOP doing corporate bidding with backing from white nationalists. /eof
Democrats have walked out of legislatures, too: decades ago, and over gerrymandering attempts that would have guaranteed eternal minority rule by rendering the majority of state votes irrelevant. /12
The Republicans who keep walking out on their jobs get 65 percent of their donations from corporations, in particular corporations like Koch Industries with assets that stand to be affected by cap-and-trade." /11
Oregon has some of the nation's loosest money-in-politics laws and the state GOP is awash in money from polluting industries hoping to render the planet unfit for habitation ("first in the country in per-capita corporate donations to politicians")  https://projects.oregonlive.com/polluted-by-money/part-1 … /10
Democrats have bent over backward to accommodate GOP objections, layering on more process, making more concessions, but it hasn’t changed Republican rhetoric or behavior a whit. GOP objections aren’t to the bill’s contents or process, but to its existence." 9/
They fucking lied. GOP Senators went into hiding, and have threatened to murder any police officers sent to get them. 5/
They've killed a small tax raise to fully fund state public schools, modest gun restrictions, and mandatory vaccinations for kids. Then they signed a memo promising not to pull that stunt again, so the legislature could pursue a cap-and-trade bill. 4/ pic.twitter.com/7DLhZA9YLy
The Oregon GOP, acting on behalf of a small number of rural, white, reactionary voters, has refused to enter the statehouse when the majority was calling votes on "guns, forestry, health care, budgeting" and now, the climate crisis.  https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/2/29/21157246/oregon-republicans-walk-out-climate-change-cap-trade-democracy … 3/
Theoretically, this has meant that if a small handful of opposition lawmakers refused to show up for work, the state legislature would shut down. Practically, neither party has ever done this...until now. 2/
In Oregon, Democrats have a supermajority in the House and Senate, because the vast majority of Orgeonians support Democratic policies. But when Oregon drafted its constitution in 1857, it copied the Indiana constitution's provision that sets quorum at 2/3 of lawmakers. 1/

People who sell security need to sell fear. If we want our kids to care about their privacy, we can't make them "safe" by spying on them all the time and banning any steps they take to make us stop. /eof
They make bizarre claims ("the average 7th grader has 6 Instagram accounts" - which would make 7th graders 25% of the entire IG user-base). And they find terrified parents to endorse spying ("If it’s going to protect my child, I don’t care how you get the info, just get it"). 5/
When companies like Gaggle and Securely pitch school-boards on their products, they claim that they can detect incipient in-school ISIS attacks and the like, and use that as justification to spy on kids in-school and out-of-school online activities. 3/
Meanwhile, censorware companies - whose primary customers have always been oppressive regimes seeking to control political oppositions - have morphed into full-on student surveillance companies, and their sales pitch is a terrifying slurry of war-on-terror/active shooter FUD. 2/
We spend a lot of time bemoaning the lack of privacy-consciousness among kids, and then we spy on them at school with censorware and punish them for taking any action that might protect their privacy from us.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAGjNe1YhMA … 1/
