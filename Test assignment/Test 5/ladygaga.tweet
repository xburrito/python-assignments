Oh I see @realDonaldTrump you're not helping PR because of the electoral votes u need to be re-elected #Florida=29 #Texas=38 #PuertoRico=0
I this it's clear where the 'poor leadership' lies @realDonaldTrump Puerto Rico is part of the United States. This is our responsibility.

Within the Trans Community are many also who are strong & brave. They should be able to serve if they wish. To have honor if they do @POTUS
. @POTUS Sincerely, did you know of the group you singled out today, 45% of them ages (18 to 24) have attempted suicide already?
Many of these young people are transgender & suffer daily from the exact types of social isolation & targeting ur message encourages @POTUS
. @Potus Research says at least 1/2 of High School, University Students, & Employed Young People rarely/never discuss mental issues w/ anyone
The message you have just sent has endangered the lives of people all over the United States and overseas bravely serving our nation @POTUS

Check out&trend #WhyWomenDontReport to have a better understanding. For me, it was like re-living it all over again. I applaud these women.
Thanku to the panelists @AC360 for explaining why women are coming forward now: because Trumps words @debate sent abused women into a panic
. @FLOTUS watching you speak on @CNN in New Hampshire in tears. You are a true role model and leader.
. @SenatorFischer you are a female senator supporting misogyny. Putting our daughters in danger. Has your young courage faded?
You can download the album and share earbuds on the ride you'll love listening to it together  https://twitter.com/rickygagaa/status/786065154727350272 …
Silver Lining of #PssyGate: Maybe the world will recognize the normalization of male sexual violence. #HeyGirl it ain't easy.
Brutalizing Bill & Chelsea, are these the qualities of a president? "I know! Let's go after her FAMILY!" Not even high school level politics
. @GovMikeHuckabee Did u just argue that it's ok for the President of the United States to be Vulgar&Crude? Whitehouse is better than that.
Someone once told me: The press IS politics. Press influences the election. Dear Press: you can give power, you can also take it away. #Vote
So many Republicans no longer supporting Trmp. I may not be conservative but I'm Christian. Thank u for standing by what's morally right.
Did he just say? "How stupid is our country?"-Trump VERY IMPORTANT TO VOTE #presidentialdebate #Vote #Vote4America
Is everyone seeing how important it is to #vote? #presidentialdebate I'm as equally suspended in absurdity. Why is he hovering around her?
Calling all Monsters! Watch the debate in 30 min, I am! If you don't know who to vote for... #Vote4America #PresidentialDebate pic.twitter.com/8N7ImLIr7r
God Bless Haiti and everyone affected by this hurricane. The world is praying for you and the Carolinas. We must care for Mother Nature.
